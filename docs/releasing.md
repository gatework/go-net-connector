# Releasing go-net-connector

The release owner publishes the downloaded bytes from one successful **exact commit** of the `Go` workflow. The workflow has read-only repository permissions and creates no tag or GitHub release. Branch pushes and manual runs may produce artifacts after every gate passes; pull requests run checks without packaging.

## Gates and dependency boundary

The runtime matrix is Ubuntu/macOS with the latest Go 1.26 and 1.27 patches. Every cell verifies module checksums and `go mod tidy -diff`, builds all five commands, enables the installed archive-worker test, then runs shuffled, uncached race tests and vet. Temporary PostgreSQL integration runs when `initdb` and `pg_ctl` are installed; otherwise the log explicitly reports that skip. This is separate from real network-device evidence.

The quality job uses golangci-lint v2.15.0 (only govet, ineffassign, staticcheck SA checks and unused), govulncheck v1.9.0 and actionlint v1.7.12. Action versions are pinned to reviewed upstream commit SHAs in the workflow. Packaging and security use the latest Go 1.27 patch; the exact compiler version is recorded in `MANIFEST.json` and checked against every binary's Go build information. Go 1.27-built Darwin binaries require macOS 13 or newer.

All release checks and builds use `GOWORK=off`, read-only module resolution and the selected local toolchain. `scripts/release.py check-modules` rejects every `replace` directive and `v0.0.0` dependency. A development workspace or an unpublished dependency cannot satisfy this gate. A compatible published go-expect version must be pinned by the release owner before the real package can succeed.

## Artifact contract

Set the committed `VERSION` to a non-placeholder `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. From a checkout of the intended SHA:

```sh
bash scripts/ci
python3 scripts/test_release.py -v
python3 scripts/release.py package --sha "$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
python3 scripts/release.py verify --sha "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" --version "$(cat VERSION)"
```

Packaging rejects tracked worktree/index changes and existing output paths. It reads all build inputs from the committed Git tree into a temporary directory, so untracked files and local workspace replacements never enter the build. Submodules and symlinks escaping the source root are rejected. Existing output is never overwritten; use a new directory with `--output` for an independent verification build.

The single CI artifact is named `release-FULL_SHA-RUN_ATTEMPT` and contains eight files:

- Four `go-net-connector_VERSION_FULL_SHA_OS_ARCH.tar.gz` archives for Linux/Darwin × amd64/arm64. Each includes all five commands under `bin/`, README, project license, complete dependency license/notice texts, VERSION and REVISION.
- `go-net-connector_VERSION_FULL_SHA_source.tar.gz`, containing the exact committed tree under `go-net-connector/`, preserving executable modes and safe symlinks.
- `REVISION`, `MANIFEST.json` and `SHA256SUMS`.

The manifest records version, SHA, compiler and every platform payload's file sizes, modes and SHA-256 digests. `SHA256SUMS` covers all other files, including the manifest. Tar entries have deterministic ordering, ownership and timestamps; gzip records no local filename and uses a zero timestamp. Go builds use `CGO_ENABLED=0`, `-trimpath`, no build ID and an embedded version/SHA identity. Reproducibility means the same tree and toolchain; changing a compiler patch can change binaries. Verification checks the source bytes and modes against Git, the exact archive/asset file sets, checksums, payload manifests, embedded identity and Go command/platform/toolchain metadata. It does not trust a rewritten checksum list alone.

The package job runs all five Linux archive binaries' `--version`, uses the archive's installed worker in its pipe integration test, then tests the extracted source with published dependencies. Fixture tests cross-build all twenty binaries twice and cover rehashed corruption, missing/extra payloads, wrong identity, dirty source, placeholders, replacements, unsafe links and refusal to overwrite artifacts.

## Manual publication by the release owner

1. Verify the private repository and intended release scope. Commit and push the reviewed source and dependency pin. Wait for a successful `Go` run whose `headSha` is the intended commit and whose matrix, quality and package jobs all passed. A different SHA's green run does not authorize this release.
2. Record the workflow run ID, run attempt and immutable upload-artifact ID. Download **that run's** `release-FULL_SHA-RUN_ATTEMPT` artifact to a fresh directory. Do not build publication bytes locally and do not substitute an artifact from a later run.
3. Check out the same SHA in a clean release checkout and run the verifier against the downloaded directory. Inspect `MANIFEST.json`, source correspondence, dependency notices and the platform archives. Retain the artifact ID and GitHub-reported artifact digest alongside the release evidence.
4. Confirm the intended tag and release do not already exist. Create the tag at the verified full SHA, then create the GitHub release with all eight downloaded files. For example, after filling in the recorded values:

```sh
gh run view "$release_run" --json headSha,conclusion,jobs
gh run download "$release_run" --name "release-$release_sha-$release_attempt" --dir "$release_download"
python3 scripts/release.py verify --sha "$release_sha" --version "$release_version" --output "$release_download"
# Execute only after the owner has reviewed the exact run/artifact and absent tag/release.
git tag "$release_version" "$release_sha"
git push origin "refs/tags/$release_version"
gh release create "$release_version" "$release_download"/* --verify-tag --title "$release_version" --notes-file "$release_notes"
```

5. Read back the remote tag target, release state, all asset names/bytes/checksums and private visibility. Download the release assets to a second fresh directory and run the same verifier. Test installed binaries and an extracted-source consumer independently; record local, CI, consumer and publication evidence separately.

Never force a tag, clobber existing assets or rebuild for an upload retry. If a tag/release already exists, compare its target and assets before deciding how to recover. Artifact retention is 30 days; download and retain the reviewed CI bytes before they expire.
